hypercute
=========

A cookiecutter for Python 3 CLI projects with modern python tools.

This project template is to some extent based on the article and template
`Hypermodern Python <hypermodern>`__ by Claudio Jolowicz.

I have adapted some details:

* Instead of Poetry_ we use Flit_ for packaging.
* We make the use of Codecov_ optional (you might want to use this template in private/proprietary projects as well).
